You'll also hear plenty of new music ranging from hardcore honky tonkers like Roger Wallace and Heather Myles to edgy alt-country artists like Neko Case, the Drive-By Truckers and Fred Eaglesmith. \\n\\nI try to keep listeners up-to-date with what's happening now in the wide world of country music, while also bringing to light the richness and diversity of country's past. I'll also do my best to put the music in context by structuring the show so you can see the connections between different songs, artists and styles, along with sharing anecdotes and other bits of information about the music. \\n\\nI also try to give folks a chance to hear country artists that are coming to town soon, while also supporting Seattle's twang community by regularly playing the music of local artists. \\n\\nMore than anything else, I try to play music that moves you, whether it's a song that makes you jump with joy or one that rips your heart out. \\n\\n-Don Slack",

You'll also hear plenty of new music ranging from hardcore honky tonkers like Roger Wallace and Heather Myles to edgy alt-country artists like Neko Case, the Drive-By Truckers and Fred Eaglesmith. \\n\\nI try to keep listeners up-to-date with what's happening now in the wide world of country music, while also bringing to light the richness and diversity of country's past. I'll also do my best to put the music in context by structuring the show so you can see the connections between different songs, artists and styles, along with sharing anecdotes and other bits of information about the music. \\n\\nI also try to give folks a chance to hear country artists that are coming to town soon, while also supporting Seattle's twang community by regularly playing the music of local artists. \\n\\nMore than anything else, I try to play music that moves you, whether it's a song that makes you jump with joy or one that rips your heart out. \\n\\n-Don Slack",

The show presents the wide and wonderful spectrum of our musical legacy - the roots of todays popular music and culture. The show explores regional differences in American recordings with a decidely Southern bent. \\n\\nAs a programmer/producer, my goal is to create a mix of American music that transcends simple definitions and catergories of style. I play blues, but also country blues, piano blues, folk blues, zydeco, punk blues and whatever new interpretations come along. I play country and folk, but also old-time mountain music, bluegrass, singer/songwriters, cajun, folk/country rock, and any revival that comes next. In addition, the show recogonizes the importance of the church in the developement of popular American music - gospel spirituals laid a foundation for bluegrass, rhythm and blues and soul music. I try to play the new with the old, and the known next to the unknown. \\n\\nUltimately, I hope the show is an alternative to what's known as \"American roots\" or any \"boomer\" definition of roots-rock turns classic-rock. I play a mix which hopefully turns the familiar fresh and demostrates that we always return to the source - it's just one music eventually. \\n\\n-Greg Vandy ",

Now! \\n\\nIn recent years, jazz has been cast in an unfortunate historical context -- as something that already happened, and is now over. Or, individual \"experts\" are too willing to narrowly define jazz - like; it sounds like this, and like that, and like this -- and if it doesn't, it isn't jazz. \\n\\nI think instead, that jazz, like any vibrant art form, has a mandate to expand and recreate itself -- to try new things, to get better, or at least to be different today than it was yesterday. Certainly jazz has a rich history. But part of that history is expansion and progression. Jazz never has stood still for long, there's no reason to think is should now. \\n\\nIn programming Jazz Theater I look for compelling work by artists who have been willing to blaze new trails. Clearly they have all studied the history of jazz, and thankfully they are not willing to be confined by it. Some of Jazz Theater will be familiar and, hopefully, some of it will be like nothing you've ever heard before. \\n\\n-John Gilbreath",

Even at its inception it has always been important that the show not be commanded by any monolithic style or single host, but has always enjoyed 3 hosts who bring a variety of influences and style to the final mix. An Expansions mix will include old and new releases in its mix in a variety of genres. An Expansions mix can included trip-hop, chill, ambient, drum and bass, house, dub, electronica, jazz, sometimes world music, sometimes rock, sometimes....well sometimes even the most disparate elements come together thanks to the expert curator efforts of its current hosts Kid Hops, Masa, and Riz. \\n\\n-DJ Riz",

He has been corrupted by metal since he was a little grub. He had an unlikely start in radio around the age of 12 or 13 when he had a local mechanic build a FM transmitter for trade and started his hometowns only pirate radio station. Running a pirate radio station with his hooligan friends eventually led to writing and playing music. Tanner played guitar and screeched in many terrible punk and metal bands over the years. After moving to Seattle, he guest DJ'ed for KEXP's Sonic Reducer as well as several venues and events.<br /><br /> Tanner has sought out every blackened forest and gruesome abbitoir of the underground extreme metal world seeking incredible music. He grew up loving everything from old school death metal to the most atmospheric, ethereal black metal to haunt the the Pacific Northwest. Tanner has a rabid affection for listening to records and tapes and plays mostly vinyl every week on Seek & Destroy to ensure the best possible sound quality for listeners.<br /><br /> When not sharpening battle axes and hanging out in spooky caves, he sculpts and models undead soldiers from beyond the void and draws pictures of dragons and space wizards. He is currently a Senior Production Artist at HBO making all kinds of rad stuff.<br /><br /> Facebook - <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP</a><br />Instagram - <a href=\"https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp\" target=\"_blank\">https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp</a>",

He has been corrupted by metal since he was a little grub. He had an unlikely start in radio around the age of 12 or 13 when he had a local mechanic build a FM transmitter for trade and started his hometowns only pirate radio station. Running a pirate radio station with his hooligan friends eventually led to writing and playing music. Tanner played guitar and screeched in many terrible punk and metal bands over the years. After moving to Seattle, he guest DJ'ed for KEXP's Sonic Reducer as well as several venues and events.<br /><br /> Tanner has sought out every blackened forest and gruesome abbitoir of the underground extreme metal world seeking incredible music. He grew up loving everything from old school death metal to the most atmospheric, ethereal black metal to haunt the the Pacific Northwest. Tanner has a rabid affection for listening to records and tapes and plays mostly vinyl every week on Seek & Destroy to ensure the best possible sound quality for listeners.<br /><br /> When not sharpening battle axes and hanging out in spooky caves, he sculpts and models undead soldiers from beyond the void and draws pictures of dragons and space wizards. He is currently a Senior Production Artist at HBO making all kinds of rad stuff.<br /><br /> Facebook - <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP</a><br />Instagram - <a href=\"https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp\" target=\"_blank\">https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp</a>",

The show presents the wide and wonderful spectrum of our musical legacy - the roots of todays popular music and culture. The show explores regional differences in American recordings with a decidely Southern bent. \\n\\nAs a programmer/producer, my goal is to create a mix of American music that transcends simple definitions and catergories of style. I play blues, but also country blues, piano blues, folk blues, zydeco, punk blues and whatever new interpretations come along. I play country and folk, but also old-time mountain music, bluegrass, singer/songwriters, cajun, folk/country rock, and any revival that comes next. In addition, the show recogonizes the importance of the church in the developement of popular American music - gospel spirituals laid a foundation for bluegrass, rhythm and blues and soul music. I try to play the new with the old, and the known next to the unknown. \\n\\nUltimately, I hope the show is an alternative to what's known as \"American roots\" or any \"boomer\" definition of roots-rock turns classic-rock. I play a mix which hopefully turns the familiar fresh and demostrates that we always return to the source - it's just one music eventually. \\n\\n-Greg Vandy ",

Now! \\n\\nIn recent years, jazz has been cast in an unfortunate historical context -- as something that already happened, and is now over. Or, individual \"experts\" are too willing to narrowly define jazz - like; it sounds like this, and like that, and like this -- and if it doesn't, it isn't jazz. \\n\\nI think instead, that jazz, like any vibrant art form, has a mandate to expand and recreate itself -- to try new things, to get better, or at least to be different today than it was yesterday. Certainly jazz has a rich history. But part of that history is expansion and progression. Jazz never has stood still for long, there's no reason to think is should now. \\n\\nIn programming Jazz Theater I look for compelling work by artists who have been willing to blaze new trails. Clearly they have all studied the history of jazz, and thankfully they are not willing to be confined by it. Some of Jazz Theater will be familiar and, hopefully, some of it will be like nothing you've ever heard before. \\n\\n-John Gilbreath",

Even at its inception it has always been important that the show not be commanded by any monolithic style or single host, but has always enjoyed 3 hosts who bring a variety of influences and style to the final mix. An Expansions mix will include old and new releases in its mix in a variety of genres. An Expansions mix can included trip-hop, chill, ambient, drum and bass, house, dub, electronica, jazz, sometimes world music, sometimes rock, sometimes....well sometimes even the most disparate elements come together thanks to the expert curator efforts of its current hosts Kid Hops, Masa, and Riz. \\n\\n-DJ Riz",

He has been corrupted by metal since he was a little grub. He had an unlikely start in radio around the age of 12 or 13 when he had a local mechanic build a FM transmitter for trade and started his hometowns only pirate radio station. Running a pirate radio station with his hooligan friends eventually led to writing and playing music. Tanner played guitar and screeched in many terrible punk and metal bands over the years. After moving to Seattle, he guest DJ'ed for KEXP's Sonic Reducer as well as several venues and events.<br /><br /> Tanner has sought out every blackened forest and gruesome abbitoir of the underground extreme metal world seeking incredible music. He grew up loving everything from old school death metal to the most atmospheric, ethereal black metal to haunt the the Pacific Northwest. Tanner has a rabid affection for listening to records and tapes and plays mostly vinyl every week on Seek & Destroy to ensure the best possible sound quality for listeners.<br /><br /> When not sharpening battle axes and hanging out in spooky caves, he sculpts and models undead soldiers from beyond the void and draws pictures of dragons and space wizards. He is currently a Senior Production Artist at HBO making all kinds of rad stuff.<br /><br /> Facebook - <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP</a><br />Instagram - <a href=\"https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp\" target=\"_blank\">https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp</a>",

You'll also hear plenty of new music ranging from hardcore honky tonkers like Roger Wallace and Heather Myles to edgy alt-country artists like Neko Case, the Drive-By Truckers and Fred Eaglesmith. \\n\\nI try to keep listeners up-to-date with what's happening now in the wide world of country music, while also bringing to light the richness and diversity of country's past. I'll also do my best to put the music in context by structuring the show so you can see the connections between different songs, artists and styles, along with sharing anecdotes and other bits of information about the music. \\n\\nI also try to give folks a chance to hear country artists that are coming to town soon, while also supporting Seattle's twang community by regularly playing the music of local artists. \\n\\nMore than anything else, I try to play music that moves you, whether it's a song that makes you jump with joy or one that rips your heart out. \\n\\n-Don Slack",

The show presents the wide and wonderful spectrum of our musical legacy - the roots of todays popular music and culture. The show explores regional differences in American recordings with a decidely Southern bent. \\n\\nAs a programmer/producer, my goal is to create a mix of American music that transcends simple definitions and catergories of style. I play blues, but also country blues, piano blues, folk blues, zydeco, punk blues and whatever new interpretations come along. I play country and folk, but also old-time mountain music, bluegrass, singer/songwriters, cajun, folk/country rock, and any revival that comes next. In addition, the show recogonizes the importance of the church in the developement of popular American music - gospel spirituals laid a foundation for bluegrass, rhythm and blues and soul music. I try to play the new with the old, and the known next to the unknown. \\n\\nUltimately, I hope the show is an alternative to what's known as \"American roots\" or any \"boomer\" definition of roots-rock turns classic-rock. I play a mix which hopefully turns the familiar fresh and demostrates that we always return to the source - it's just one music eventually. \\n\\n-Greg Vandy ",

Now! \\n\\nIn recent years, jazz has been cast in an unfortunate historical context -- as something that already happened, and is now over. Or, individual \"experts\" are too willing to narrowly define jazz - like; it sounds like this, and like that, and like this -- and if it doesn't, it isn't jazz. \\n\\nI think instead, that jazz, like any vibrant art form, has a mandate to expand and recreate itself -- to try new things, to get better, or at least to be different today than it was yesterday. Certainly jazz has a rich history. But part of that history is expansion and progression. Jazz never has stood still for long, there's no reason to think is should now. \\n\\nIn programming Jazz Theater I look for compelling work by artists who have been willing to blaze new trails. Clearly they have all studied the history of jazz, and thankfully they are not willing to be confined by it. Some of Jazz Theater will be familiar and, hopefully, some of it will be like nothing you've ever heard before. \\n\\n-John Gilbreath",

Even at its inception it has always been important that the show not be commanded by any monolithic style or single host, but has always enjoyed 3 hosts who bring a variety of influences and style to the final mix. An Expansions mix will include old and new releases in its mix in a variety of genres. An Expansions mix can included trip-hop, chill, ambient, drum and bass, house, dub, electronica, jazz, sometimes world music, sometimes rock, sometimes....well sometimes even the most disparate elements come together thanks to the expert curator efforts of its current hosts Kid Hops, Masa, and Riz. \\n\\n-DJ Riz",

He has been corrupted by metal since he was a little grub. He had an unlikely start in radio around the age of 12 or 13 when he had a local mechanic build a FM transmitter for trade and started his hometowns only pirate radio station. Running a pirate radio station with his hooligan friends eventually led to writing and playing music. Tanner played guitar and screeched in many terrible punk and metal bands over the years. After moving to Seattle, he guest DJ'ed for KEXP's Sonic Reducer as well as several venues and events.<br /><br /> Tanner has sought out every blackened forest and gruesome abbitoir of the underground extreme metal world seeking incredible music. He grew up loving everything from old school death metal to the most atmospheric, ethereal black metal to haunt the the Pacific Northwest. Tanner has a rabid affection for listening to records and tapes and plays mostly vinyl every week on Seek & Destroy to ensure the best possible sound quality for listeners.<br /><br /> When not sharpening battle axes and hanging out in spooky caves, he sculpts and models undead soldiers from beyond the void and draws pictures of dragons and space wizards. He is currently a Senior Production Artist at HBO making all kinds of rad stuff.<br /><br /> Facebook - <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.facebook.com/SeekAndDestroyOnKEXP</a><br />Instagram - <a href=\"https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp\" target=\"_blank\">https://instagram.com/seekanddestroy_kexp</a>",
